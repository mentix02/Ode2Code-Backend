# Ode2Code-Backend

## About

Ode2Code is an open source platform for software developers who want to contribute to the developer community by writing tutorials and documentation for people who are new to the field. Users can sign up and write (or read) tutorials about different topics ranging from a programming language to complex graph algorithms for free.

And if the readers like it, they can upvote the tutorial which would increase the authors' reputation.

There are groups of tutorials known as series that sort tutorials covering a topic that can't be fully taught in just one post.

People can also write blogs in the blog section to publish or reach out to more people about open source projects that might start or a papers they might publish. And if a user is active as a writer, they can submit a request to be verified (provided they have sufficient reputation) which would give them priority whenever they publish a piece meaning search results would bend in their favour and they can also report tutorials that aren't up to the mark for review.

The website is by no means complete and is full of untested features. Contributors will be welcomed with open arms.

## Contributing

Ode2Code is a two part website that constitutes the backend and the frontend. This is the git repo for the backend which is written in [Python](https://www.python.org "python.org") using the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/ "djangoproject.org") framework. Extensive experience with both will be required to write more features or fix bugs in the project.

A good working knowledge of the api of the [Django Rest Framework](https://django-rest-framework.org) will also be extremely useful while contributing. If you're not interested in writing code for the site, you can also help out by submitting any errors you encounter in the [Issues Panel](https://github.com/mentix02/Ode2Code-Backend/issues "Ode2Code Issues"). Use the Issues Panel to also subumit any requests for features you'd like to see in upcoming versions of Ode2Code.

If you're looking for the frontend (which is written in React), you can find it [here](https://www.github.com/mentix02/Ode2Code-Frontend/ "Ode2Code Frontend").
