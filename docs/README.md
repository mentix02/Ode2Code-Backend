## Development

To setup your local development server on your machine, all you need to do is have a MySQL database installed on your Linux based machine. Then just run `make` to run the `bin/install.sh` script.

Then enter the fields that are prompted. All inputs, by the way, remain stored only on your disk. Nowhere else.
